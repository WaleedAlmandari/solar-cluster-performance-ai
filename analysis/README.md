Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) outputs for the Solar Cluster Performance project.
The analysis focuses on understanding solar power generation behavior, identifying performance differences among clusters, and supporting machine learning model development.

Purpose of the Analysis

The main objectives of the exploratory data analysis are to:

Understand the relationship between solar irradiance and power output

Compare performance across different solar clusters

Identify daily and hourly power generation patterns

Analyze efficiency variations among clusters

Detect trends, variability, and potential anomalies in the data

The insights obtained from this analysis guide feature engineering and model selection.

Included Visualizations

The following visualizations are included in this folder as image files:

Irradiance vs Total Power Output
Illustrates the relationship between sunlight intensity and generated power.

Average Power Output per Cluster
Compares the average power generation across all solar clusters.

Daily Total Power Generation
Shows variations in total energy production across different days.

Solar Irradiance Distribution
Displays the distribution of irradiance values throughout the dataset.

Power Output Distribution by Cluster
Highlights variability, medians, and outliers in cluster performance.

Efficiency Distribution by Cluster
Compares how efficiently each cluster converts irradiance into power.

Hourly Power Distribution
Demonstrates how power generation varies throughout the day.

Data Source

All visualizations are generated from the processed dataset derived from inverter and weather station data.
Only cleaned and validated data is used to ensure meaningful and reliable analysis.

Notes

All figures are exported directly from the analysis notebook to maintain consistency.

Visualizations are stored as images for quick inspection without running the notebook.

The analysis supports both regression and classification modeling tasks.
