Interactive Dashboard

This folder contains an interactive Streamlit dashboard developed for the Solar Cluster Performance project.
The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore solar power data, view machine learning predictions, and analyze cluster performance.

Purpose of the Dashboard

The dashboard is designed to:

Visualize solar power generation trends

Display regression model predictions for power output

Show classification results for cluster performance

Allow users to explore results without interacting with the analysis notebook

It serves as a bridge between technical analysis and practical decision-making.

Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes the following main components:

Power Output Visualization
Displays solar power trends and patterns across clusters.

Regression Prediction Results
Shows predicted power output generated by the trained regression model.

Cluster Performance Classification
Indicates whether a cluster is classified as high or low performance based on efficiency.

Interactive Tables and Charts
Enables users to explore sample predictions and results dynamically.

Dashboard Assets

Screenshots of the dashboard interface are available in the assets folder.
These images provide a quick preview of the dashboard layout and functionality.

How to Run the Dashboard

To run the dashboard locally:

Install the required Python dependencies listed in the project requirements file.

Launch the Streamlit application from the project root directory.

Notes

The dashboard uses trained machine learning models stored in the models folder.

Sample processed data is used to ensure the dashboard runs efficiently.

The dashboard complements the analysis notebook by offering an accessible and interactive view of the results.
